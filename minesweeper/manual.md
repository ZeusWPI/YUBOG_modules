## Minesweeper

Welcome to minesweeper!

The grid is **13 by 10**, featuring **129** bombs.
We would like to know which location we don't have to clear to avoid unnecessary work.

Look at your serial code.
Consider top left location as having coordinates $(0, 0)$.

To obtain the **y coordinate** (up → down), add the digits of your serial code.
Wrap around at the edge.

To obtain the **x coordinate** (left → right), add the alphabetic value of the letters of your serial code.
The letter "A" has value 0.
Wrap around at the edge.
