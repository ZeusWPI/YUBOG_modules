# Type Racer

The lights show a color combination, you need to figure out what they mean! \
Depending on the order they can either mean that you need to type the text faster or slower than the given given words per minute. \
The timer starts when you start typing and stops when you press ENTER.

If none of the light rules match then you need to type faster \
If more than one rule matches then the last matching rule is the one that needs to be followed! \
In all cases, if the first light is orange then you need to do the opposite of what the rules say

1. If there's no yellow then you need to type slower
2. If one of the lights is purple then you need to type faster
3. If the third light is blue then you need to type slower
4. If the second light is green en there's no red then you need to type faster
5. if the third light is pink en the first is neither blue nor green then you need to type faster
6. If the third light is orange en the first is not green then you need to type slower
7. If the first light is blue and the second light is green then you need to type faster
