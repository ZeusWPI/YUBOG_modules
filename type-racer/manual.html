      <span>Type Racer!</span>
      <span>The lights show a color combination, you need to figure out what they mean!</span>
      <span>Depending on the order they can either mean that you need to type the sentence faster or slower than the given words per minute</span>
      <span>The timer starts when you start typing and stops when you press ENTER</span>
      </p>
      <span>If none of the light rules match then you need to type faster</span>
      <span>If more than one rule matches then the last matching rule is the one that needs to be followed!</span>
      <span>In all cases, if the first light is orange then you need to do the opposite of what the rules say</span>
      </p>
      <span>If there's no yellow then you need to type slower</span>
      <span>If one of the lights is purple then you need to type faster</span>
      <span>If the third light is blue then you need to type slower</span>
      <span>If the second light is green en there's no red then you need to type faster</span>
      <span>if the third light is pink en the first is neither blue nor green then you need to type faster</span>
      <span>If the third light is orange en the first is not green then you need to type slower</span>
